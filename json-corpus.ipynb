    "# Importing ORACC Data from corpus.json -- Obsolete\n",
    "by Niek Veldhuis\n",
    "UC Berkeley\n",
    "\n",
    "February-May 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "# NOTE\n",
    "This notebook has been superseded by the Notebooks First_JSON_parser.ipynb, Second_JSON_parser.ipynb, and Third_JSON_parse.ipynb. Instead of the `ijson` library, which allows one to iterate through the entire text of the JSON file, these parsers utilize the structure of ORACC JSON in a much simplified parser. The current notebook is now obsolete and is no longer maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of the code is to download [ORACC](http://oracc.org) JSON files that contain textual data and to produce a `.csv` file with the relevant data for use in computational text analysis. This comes in the place of scraping the published `html` (see the [Scrape-ORACC](https://github.com/niekveldhuis/Digital-Assyriology/tree/master/Scrape-Oracc) repo). The JSON files contain all the transliteration and lemmatization data of an ORACC project as well as metadata . For an introduction to the various ORACC JSON files see the [ORACC Open Data](http://oracc.org/doc/opendata) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting data file may include various elements of the ORACC data structure. The current code will output a file with the following fields: \n",
    "\n",
    "* id_line\n",
    "* label\n",
    "* lemma\n",
    "* base\n",
    "* extent\n",
    "* scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The fields `extent` and `scope` capture the number of missing lines or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of fields may be adjusted with standard `Pandas` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "The current version of the script works with the `ijson` library. Documentation for [ijson](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-json-tutorial/), unfortunately, is extremely brief. It is likely that in the near future, because of considerations of space, [ORACC](http://oracc.org) will no longer make available individual `.json` files, but only the file `json.zip`, a compressed file that includes all the `.json` files that belong to a single project. For that reason the current code will first download the `json.zip` and then extract the relevant files (at the moment of writing this note it is still possible to directly download such files from the [ORACC](http://oracc.org) server. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is written for **Python 3.5** with **Pandas 0.19** and **ijson 2.3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of this notebook will download and parse data from any [ORACC](http://oracc.org) project (or combination of projects). For most purposes, the number of data elements extracted will be too large and it will be necessary to select and manipulate the data set. The second section of the notebook selects only proper nouns (personal names, royal names, geographical names, etc.) and prepares the data for usage in Social Network Analysis software. This is only one example of how the data may be used, other usages could include topic modeling, word2vec, etc. Each of those analyses requires a specific data format and therefore specific data manipulation. Further examples of how such manipulation might work are foreseen for a later version of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial version of this notebook was written for the [Phylogenetics](https://github.com/ErinBecker/digital-humanities-phylogenetics) project with Erin Becker of [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org). \n",

The fields that are aggregated are `lemma`, `base`, `extent`, and `scope`. The fields `extent` and `scope` represent data on the number of broken lines.
